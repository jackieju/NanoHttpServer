Every http server is so heavy. I just need a server can be started in 1 min from downloading.
The initial goal is need some testing tool for my working on intalio project.

1. checkout source code
git clone git@github.com:jackieju/SimpleHttpServer.git
# checkout the source code for symbol link clib and os
git clone git@github.com:jackieju/mse.git 

2. make by
> make
3. run by
bin/server -p <port>

done.
